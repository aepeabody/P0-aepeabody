# Project 0: Dodge the Creeps
Author: Annie Peabody, 
following a tutorial from [Your First Game Tutorial on godotengine.org](https://docs.GodotEngine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html)

# Project Report:
This tutorial was very helpful to get familiarized with some of the basic tools of Godot and I definitely was able to be a better grasp on how the nodes work and interact. There are often menus hidden within menus and navigating those were slightly difficult at first but I was able to get a better handle on it over time. There were a lot of little quick ways to accomplish something I wouldn't have thought to do otherwise such as mapping hitboxes to all of the different entities which I would've assumed needed to be done more manually.
## Self-Evaluation:

- [x] C-1: the tutorial has been completed
- [x] B-1: .gitignore file is correcrly specified in the repository
- [x] A-1: the project report is complete as per the instruction

By all my knowledge, all stated requirements have been met earning the grade A
